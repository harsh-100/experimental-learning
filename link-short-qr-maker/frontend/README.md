# Frontend — Link Short + QR Maker

This is a minimal React + Vite + Tailwind frontend for the Link Short + QR Maker project.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the frontend expects the backend at `http://localhost:4000`. You can override by setting the `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable.

Example:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000 npm run dev
```
