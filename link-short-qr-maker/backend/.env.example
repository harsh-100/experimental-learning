# Example backend env for deployment
# BASE_URL should be the public URL that will serve the frontend and backend when deployed together.
# Do NOT include a trailing slash. Example:
# BASE_URL=https://example.com

# If you want the backend to automatically serve the frontend build when present, leave as is.
# Optional: set PORT (default 3000)
# PORT=3000
